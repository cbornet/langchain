    "# How to add links to Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph vector stores allow documents to be connected in different ways, allowing different types of relationships between documents to be used in retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several common types of relationships can be defined automatically, but in some cases you may want to create custom links. In this example we'll see how to create links directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How document links work;\n",
    "2. How to create links;\n",
    "3. How to extend a document with links;\n",
    "\n",
    "## How document links work\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents in a graph vector store are connected via \"links\". Links form a bipartite graph between documents and tags: documents are connected to tags, and tags are connected to other documents. When documents are retrieved from a graph vector store, a pair of documents are connected with a depth of one if both documents are connected to the same tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Links have a \"kind\", used to namespace different tag identifiers. For example a link to a keyword might use kind `kw`, while a link to a URL might use kind `url`. This allows the same tag value to be used in different contexts without causing name collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Links are directed - the directionality of links controls how the graph is traversed at retrieval time. For example, given documents A and B, connected by links to tag T:\n",
    "\n",
    "| A to T | B to T | Result |\n",
    "|--------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| outgoing | incoming | Retrieval traverses from A to B |\n",
    "| incoming | incoming | No traversal from A to B |\n",
    "| outgoing | outgoing | No traversal from A to B |\n",
    "| incoming | outgoing | No traversal from A to B |\n",
    "| bidir | incoming | Retrieval traverses from A to B |\n",
    "| bidir | outgoing | No traversal from A to B |\n",
    "| outgoing | bidir | Retrieval traverses from A to B |\n",
    "| incoming | bidir | No traversal from A to B |\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed links make it possible to describe relationships such as term references / definitions: term definitions are generally relevant to any documents that use the term, but the full set of documents using a term generally aren't relevant to the term's definition.\n",
